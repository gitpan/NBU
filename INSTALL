Installing this distribution of the NBU modules themselves involves the
usual incantations:
	tar zxf NBU-???.tar.Z
	cd NBU-???
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
where ??? is the distribution of which you are now the proud owner.

In many environments the underlying NetBackup tools are executable by root
only.  The NBU module checks to see if it has execute access to the binaries
and, if not, prefixes every binary invocation with a call to sudo which it
expects to find in /usr/local/bin/sudo.

If you are unable to, or prefer not to, install the modules right away, you
can test them by making sure the directory where the distribution was unpacked
is included in your Perl path.  Assuming you unpacked in your home directory you
could use this:
	export PERLLIB=$HOME/NBU-???/lib:$HOME/NBU-???/blib/lib
otherwise simply go for it:
	make install

Often times system administrators prefer to keep the locally added Perl modules
away from the main distribution.  One way to affect this is to run the
"perl Makefile.PL" with a few directory overrides.  For example:
	perl Makefile.PL LIB=/usr/local/lib/perl5 \
			INSTALLSCRIPT=/usr/local/bin \
			INSTALLMAN1DIR=/usr/local/man/man1 \
			INSTALLMAN3DIR=/usr/local/man/man3
Then, to gain access to the utilities, make sure /usr/local/bin is in your
PATH, /usr/local/lib/perl5 is in your PERLLIB path and /usr/local/man is in your MANPATH.

Making local modifications in these modules is strongly discouraged, instead
please consider making your contributions available to the author so they can
be included in future releases.  If you want to create test distribution of
your own however, you can simply alter the VERSION variable in Makefile.PL,
re-create the Makefile itself and issues the command:
	make dist

As of $Date: 2007/09/24 17:15:17 $, NBU and/or its scripts and examples require the following
additional modules from cpan:
	Getopt::Std
	IPC::Open2
	Date::Parse
	Time::Local
	Curses
	XML::XPath::XMLParser
	XML::XPath

To date the author has not first hand tested the installation in a Windows
environment so if you find yourself stuck there, please contact him at:
