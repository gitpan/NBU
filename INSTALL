Installing this distribution of the NBU modules themselves involves the usual
incantations:
	tar zxf NBU-???.tar.Z
	cd NBU-???
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
where ??? is the distribution of which you are now the proud owner.

In many environments the underlying NetBackup tools are executable by root
only.  The NBU module checks to see if it has execute access to the binaries
and, if not, prefixes every binary invocation with a call to sudo which it
expects to find in /usr/local/bin/sudo.

If you are unable to, or prefer not to, install the modules right away, you can test them by making sure the directory where the distribution was unpacked is
included in your Perl path.  Assuming you unpacked in your home directory you
could use this:
	export PERLLIB=$HOME/NBU-???/lib:$HOME/NBU-???/blib/lib
otherwise simply go for it:
	make install

As of $Date: 2002/11/22 02:56:40 $, NBU and/or its scripts and examples require the following
additional modules from cpan:
	Carp
	Date::Parse
	Getopt::Std
	IPC::Open2
	Time::Local

	Curses
	XML::Simple
	XML::XPath::XMLParser
	XML::XPath

To date the author has not first hand tested the installation in a Windows
environment so if you find yourself stuck there, please contact him at:
