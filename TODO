As of $Date: 2007/11/30 13:57:29 $ the list of things we'd like to add to this
package are:
- Handle multiple volumes per image
- Cover pending mount requests somewhere and possibly automate notification
  of interested parties
- Do something useful with bplist.  But what?
- Make sure we can answer the age old question: "When I restore <xyzzy> which
  tapes will I need?"
- Determine which robot a tape was in when it filled up.  Part of an effort to
  monitor tape consumption by robot to help manage their contents.
- Add XML configuration files to:
	- manage behavior of notify and exit scripts
- Build database interface to centralized drive and media failure tracking
  system.  (bperror is nice but it doesn't carry info on DOWNED drives.)
  the vmglob command, new with 3.4, allows us to uniquely identify drives and
  robots (except that replacing drives does not update their serial numbers!)
- Investigate additional information provided by vmquery -X; a value of 0x0 in
  the flags field indicates the tape has been marked for deletion.  This format
  though carries more information and might be better used than the current -w
  layout
- License analysis against class types and client counts
