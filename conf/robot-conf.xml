This file, /usr/local/etc/robot.conf, is used by the robot-snapshot.pl
script to comment on tape robot contents.

Each robot element consists of a list of pool elements

A pool element minimally has an id attribute with its name and optionally
these additional attributes:
- full
  no more than the target number of full tapes are allowed in the robot
- empty
  there must be at least that many empty volumes available for that pool
-->


<robotLevels>

    <pool id="NetBackup" total="1"/>
  </robot>
  <robot id ="2">
    <pool id="SAP_Production" full="140"/>
    <pool id="NetBackup" total="1"/>
